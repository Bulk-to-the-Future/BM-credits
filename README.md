## Installation

### From Saleor CLI

Saleor CLI is a tool which allows to manage your Saleor Cloud resources directly from the command line.

[Saleor CLI guide] (https://docs.saleor.io/docs/3.x/developer/extending/apps/key-concepts)

```
saleor app create [your-app-name]
```

The Saleor CLI will:
- clone this repository to the specified folder
- install dependencies
- ask you weather you'd like to install the app in the environment
- create `.env` file
- create tunnel so you can test the app integration with the environment
- start the app in development mode

### Manual

1. Update Saleor URI in the `.env`. If you don't have running instance of Saleor, you create a [free dev account](https://cloud.saleor.io/)
   or run instance [locally](https://github.com/saleor/saleor-platform)
2. You'll need [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) `npm install -g pnpm` to install dependencies.


## How to add app to Saleor?

### From Saleor CLI

```
saleor app install
```
